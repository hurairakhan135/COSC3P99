# COSC3P99
## Hello and welcome to my github repository for COSC 3P99
Here I have two Google Colab notebooks

## Notebook 1
This notebook covers the basics of Graphs and Graph Neural Networks and its applications. More specifically Graph Convolitional Networks(GCNs) and what Node Classification is. This notebook goes through 4 different datasets and explains the process of how we can classify nodes through GCNs

## Notebook 2
This notebook is the project I chose, which is based on identifying licit and illicit bitcoin transactions, this has the same code as notebook one but uses the `EllipticBitcoinDataset` dataset. My explaination on this notebook is done by a presentaion video that will be in the Notebook 2 folder.
